[React Native Vs Flutter : Ultimate Comparison 2020](https://kriss.io/react-native-vs-flutter-ultimate-comparison-2020/)

Here, we have learned the pros and cons of both frameworks. It is quite difficult to decide which one is the best and there is definitely a strong competition between the two. React Native is the framework that has already made its mark and is continuously growing as well. Flutter is starting to blossom into an amazing mobile application development framework that most developers and companies will turn to in the near future. However, there are still some miles to go. As a matter of fact, the company that already has a JavaScript team for web development will definitely find it easier to transition to React Native the mobile counterpart. Flutter and dart would be new technology better suited for beginners familiar with languages like Java. Hence, both are the potential giants in the world of next-generation mobile applications. React Native has already shown and established its capabilities whereas Flutter is establishing its capabilities.

[Building Serverless Front-End Applications Using Google Cloud Platform](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/11/serverless-frontend-applications-google-cloud-platform/)

The use of serverless applications by developers to handle the business logic of their applications in on the high increase, but how does the Google Cloud — a major service provider within the public cloud — allow developers to manage serverless applications? In this article, you will learn what serverless applications are, how they are used on the Google Cloud, and also scenarios in which they can be used in a front-end application.

[前端智能化 2020 年中总结和反思](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YzbAPM0dxQTmkiEtrjhPNw)


- 最初，前端智能化方向的提出是为了给前端技术带来变革，借助 AI 和机器学习的能力拓展前端，就像拥有望远镜人类就有了神话中的千里眼，拥有了 AI 前端也会在自身能力的基础上产生更强的“超能力”。
- 随后，在保持这个目标推动的时候，发现很难落地。通过思考 AI 的能力特点、前端的生存现状，决定从“解决一线研发人员问题，提升一线研发人员幸福感。”为出发点，重构智能化的战略和战术体系。
- 最后，切入点就是设计生成代码。搭建体系日臻成熟、模块化开发方式深入人心的今天，大量需求变更和复杂的业务环境，造成前端无法用“复用”的思想简单解决问题，所以，用前端智能化进行设计稿识别和理解，再通过规则生成代码，Design to Code（D2C）能够良好的解决日常模块开发的问题。

[企业级数据可视化应用有哪些机遇与挑战？](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/vvKPJZCZNs8VfM8A07x5SA)

今天准备的主题叫做“企业级数据可视化应用的机遇与挑战”，偏向于设计体验和工程实现，主要来自于过去这些年自己在这个领域内的一些实践体会和思考，希望作为引子能给大家带来一点灵感或启发。
AntV 是蚂蚁集团的数据可视化解决方案，甚至可以说是整个阿里数据可视化的基础设施，从15年发起至今已经迭代了5年，支撑着集团内外2万+企业级应用。在这些年里我们也走过弯路，踩过很多坑，也逐渐看到些这个领域未来的趋势，所以会有今天想跟大家分享一些我们的实践和思考。

[前端组件化埋点实践](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/270189082)

我们在音街移动站中进行了迁移、在多个运营活动中进行了使用，达到了我们预期的目标；在提效方面，埋点库把费时的部分处理了，我们需要做的就是从埋点平台把坑位信息放入配置文件，业务开发的时候使用对应的组件就可以了，几乎没有太大的成本，且对于代码复用和维护来说也达到了目的。
在使用过程中发现对于点击类埋点 appendQueue 使用频率远高于 TrackerClick 组件，因为大部分元素的点击事件都有他自己的回调函数，但是我们使用 TrackerClick 的初衷是埋点代码和业务代码解耦，这个也要根据实际场景去选择。

[4 Ways to Communicate Across Browser Tabs in Realtime](https://blog.bitsrc.io/4-ways-to-communicate-across-browser-tabs-in-realtime-e4f5f6cbedca)

Over the years, Web Browser capabilities have ever increased due to the demands coming from web applications. As a result, we can find multiple ways of achieving similar functionality. One such feature we rarely look at is the ability to communicate across Browser Tabs. Let’s look at a few scenarios where you need this.

- Changing theme (e.g., Dark or Light theme) of the application propagates across the already opened Browser Tabs.
- Retrieve the latest token for authentication and share it across Browser Tabs.
- Synchronize the application state across Browser Tabs.

[Rollup: CommonJS to UMD](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/rollup-commonjs-umd-c6d019cfead)

Whereas [Webpack](https://b.remarkabl.org/3mI3vKi) is great for building apps, [Rollup](https://b.remarkabl.org/2I2FqPB) is great for building libraries.

[Effective Skeleton Screens](https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2020-11-02-skeleton-screens/)

For those unfamiliar, a skeleton screen is a method of displaying the outline (skeleton) of the content to come, typically using gray boxes and lines instead of a progress bar while content is loading. It’s a pretty creative approach to handling wait—undoubtedly more creative and helpful than a perpetually spinning circle.
But even good ideas can become bad ones if we stray too much from the original intent.

[ES2020 Optional Chaining and Dynamic Imports Are Game-Changers. Here’s Why.](https://blog.bitsrc.io/es2020-optional-chaining-and-dynamic-imports-are-game-changers-heres-why-cbbf7efae3ee)

Optional Chaining is simply a feature that allows you to safely access deeply nested properties of an object without having to check for the existence of each of them. Optional Chaining uses the `?.` operator to access the properties of objects. The usage of the `?.` operator is very similar to the typical `.` operator, but when a reference is `undefined` or `null`, rather than throwing an error, it would return `undefined`.
Dynamic Imports allow you to import JS files dynamically as modules in your application natively. Prior to ES2020, your module should be imported whether the module is used or not. This is a feature that would immensely help improve the performance of your website.

How Web Apps Work: Client Development and Deployment
_-- An overview of the concepts, terms, and data flow used in web apps: JS client development environment, tooling, and deployment_
[https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2020/11/how-web-apps-work-client-dev-deployment/](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2020/11/how-web-apps-work-client-dev-deployment/)_
Web development is a huge field with a vast array of concepts, terms, tools, and technologies. For people just getting started in web dev, this landscape is often bewildering - it's unclear what most of these pieces are, much less how they fit together.
**This post provides an overview of fundamental web dev concepts and technologies, what these pieces are, why they're needed, and how they relate to each other**. It's not a completely exhaustive reference to everything in web development, nor is it a "how to build apps" guide. Instead, it's a map of the territory, **intended to give you a sense of what the landscape looks like, and enough information that you can go research these terms and topics in more depth if needed**.

[Implementing a Staged Approach to Evolutionary Architecture](https://www.infoq.com/articles/implementing-evolutionary-architecture/)

Traditionally, software architecture and design phases have been considered as initial phases. In this approach, the architecture decisions were considered valid for the entire life of the system. With the wisdom of ages and in reaction to industry transformations, we have started to see architecture as evolving. This evolution necessitates a different set of approaches in the direction of continuous planning, facilitating via continuous integration, dashboards, and tools, thus providing guide rails for systems to evolve. This article focuses on these approaches and tools to support the journey.

[Rockpack - Skip config, code React - Interview with Sergey Aleksandrov](https://survivejs.com/blog/rockpack-interview/)

As you might know, configuring webpack isn't the most fun thing in the world and that's exactly the reason why I wrote [a thick book about it](https://survivejs.com/webpack/).
For many React users, either [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) (CRA) or framework such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) hides a lot of the complexity.
In this interview, we'll learn about a new solution called [Rockpack](https://www.rockpack.io/) from its creator Sergey Aleksandrov.**

[Back to Basics: Event Delegation](https://christianheilmann.com/2020/11/01/back-to-basics-event-delegation/)

One of my favourite tricks when it comes to building web interfaces is Event Delegation
Events don’t just happen on the element you apply them to. Instead they go all the way down the DOM tree to the event and back up again. These phases of the event lifecycle are called [event bubbling and event capture](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#Event_bubbling_and_capture).

[Comparing Various Ways to Hide Things in CSS](https://css-tricks.com/comparing-various-ways-to-hide-things-in-css/)

Developers [most commonly use](https://css-tricks.com/places-its-tempting-to-use-display-none-but-dont/) `display: none` to hide the content on the page. Unfortunately, this way of hiding content isn’t bulletproof because now that content is now [“inaccessible” to screen readers](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/2013-01-11-how-to-hide-content/). It’s tempting to use it, but especially in cases where something is only meant to be visually hidden, [don’t reach for it](https://css-tricks.com/places-its-tempting-to-use-display-none-but-dont/).

[These are the UI/UX trends you need to keep an eye out for in 2021](https://uxmag.com/articles/these-are-the-ui-ux-trends-you-need-to-keep-an-eye-out-for-in-2021)

All industries change over time. But the evolution of the design industry is the one that gets highlighted a lot. Design is one area in a product that needs to improve and advance more frequently than others. That is why product innovators and product designers should always stay ahead of the competition to make the products usable and aesthetically attractive.
What are the trends that product innovators and product designers need to look out for in the coming year? What areas will play critical roles for our products to stand out? Let’s take a firm look.

[12 Design Trends to Dominate](https://uxplanet.org/12-design-trends-to-dominate-14a0af521dc6)

Digital tendencies and users’ expectations change every day. Some trends become outdated and move beyond, but others gain ground.

[UI/UX Mastery 2021 | Pt.2: Conceptualizing & Ideation](https://uxplanet.org/ui-ux-mastery-2021-pt-2-conceptualizing-ideation-ceb835f7a5b7)

In this 4-part series, we’re covering how to research, conceptualize, design, and develop the UI for a SaaS product from the ground-up, using best-practices, tools, and techniques you can use in your next product or service design life-cycle.
You’ve done your research, you have some quotes from your users that your team has decided are the key descriptors of pain points, or product features that are the highest priority. Now what?
In this article, we’re going to cover:

- Conceptualizing product ideas from your original thoughts.
- Ideating on those concepts to create a variety of possible solutions, and
- Selecting a winner to move forward with in the design phase.

[Elements that Make a Good Design!](https://uxplanet.org/elements-that-make-a-good-design-6c13f6eed960)

The core purpose of design is to construct a product that will assist the user in achieving a goal with as little friction as possible.
Good design is often mistaken for the appealing coordination of colors or the pristine arrangement of components. On a basic level, this distinction reflects two fields involved in designing applications — UX and UI design; which can also be applied to the process of designing physical products.

[**The Only Step You Need to Progress in Your Career as a Developer or Engineer.**](https://codeburst.io/progressing-in-your-career-and-how-to-become-more-t-shaped-fe996df780d6)

I don’t usually like to write articles about myself, as it feels a bit self-indulgent, but I thought it would be useful to show examples of how I became ‘T’ shaped and how my career progressed.
The center of the ‘T’ represents the experience of understanding a particular area of technology or framework. The top part of the ‘T’ refers to an ability to collaborate with experts from other disciplines, gaining even greater understanding and knowledge from this collaboration.

[What I Learned after 4 Years of React Development](https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-11-03-what-i-learned-after-4-years-of-react-development/)

Today I was making some reflections on what challenges and new things I learned in the last few years, specifically related to programming or computer science in general. It is fair to say that I explored many new things, from IoT, computer vision, deep learning, blockchain development, and more on the programming side.
