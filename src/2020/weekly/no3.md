[飞猪营销域SSR总结 - 双十一会场再加速](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/KdaqThMs5unNBXN8o9LgQQ)

Serverless Faas和React/Rax SSR的结合实现页面的同步渲染成为我们的一个探索方向，Node Faas SSR同构实现一套代码两端运行解决复用的问题，Serverless的低运维，弹性伸缩解决SSR对机器Cpu消耗高的难题，所以今年9月开始我们在调研之后，选择对接淘系提供的比较成熟的营销域SSR方案在飞猪双十一会场落地实践。
在目前前端技术体系下，客户端预渲染、Weex、Flutter都难以成为解决多端秒出的方案，通过拥抱原生html渲染技术配合Faas SSR面向未来网络条件布局是前端页面性能往前再走一步的尝试突破，而这也是在Serverless概念热火朝天的当下云+端的最佳实践之一，从试点到通用再到普惠，刚刚走出第一步，前路漫漫仍需努力。

[Improving JavaScript performance with GPU.js](https://blog.logrocket.com/improving-javascript-performance-with-gpu-js/)

GPU.js is a JavaScript acceleration library built for the web and Node.js for general-purpose programming on graphical processing units (GPGPU). It allows you to hand over complex and time-consuming computations to GPUs rather than CPUs for faster computations and operations.

[Warp: Improved JS performance in Firefox 83](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/11/warp-improved-js-performance-in-firefox-83/)

We have enabled Warp, a significant update to [SpiderMonkey](https://spidermonkey.dev/), by default in Firefox 83. SpiderMonkey is the JavaScript engine used in the Firefox web browser.
With Warp (also called WarpBuilder) we’re making big changes to our [JIT (just-in-time) compilers](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-crash-course-in-just-in-time-jit-compilers/), resulting in improved responsiveness, faster page loads and better memory usage. The new architecture is also more maintainable and unlocks additional SpiderMonkey improvements.

[Separation of concerns with custom React hooks](https://areknawo.com/separation-of-concerns-with-custom-react-hooks/)

Among some of the more technical reasons behind people disliking React is, surprisingly, one of its biggest features as well - [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/). An extension to standard JavaScript that allows you to use HTML-like syntax in your React components.
How such a recognizable part of React, one that clearly stands to improve readability, and ease-of-writing one's code can be turned into a con? Well, it all comes down to the separation of concerns.

[What’s New In Vue 3?](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/11/new-vue3-update/)

[LibSass is Deprecated](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated)

After much discussion among the Sass core team, we’ve come to the conclusion that **it’s time to officially declare that LibSass and the packages built on top of it, including Node Sass, are deprecated. **For several years now, it’s been clear that there’s simply not enough engineering bandwidth behind LibSass to keep it up-to-date with the latest developments in the Sass language (for example, the most recent new language feature was added in [November 2018](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/3.5.5)). As much as we’ve hoped to see this pattern turn around, even the excellent work of long-time LibSass contributors Michael Mifsud and Marcel Greter couldn’t keep up with the fast pace of language development in both CSS and Sass.

[How Web Apps Work: Browsers, HTML, and CSS](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2020/11/how-web-apps-work-html-css/)

Web development is a huge field with a vast array of concepts, terms, tools, and technologies. For people just getting started in web dev, this landscape is often bewildering - it's unclear what most of these pieces are, much less how they fit together.
**This series provides an overview of fundamental web dev concepts and technologies, what these pieces are, why they're needed, and how they relate to each other**. It's not a completely exhaustive reference to everything in web development, nor is it a "how to build apps" guide. Instead, it's a map of the territory, **intended to give you a sense of what the landscape looks like, and enough information that you can go research these terms and topics in more depth if needed**.

[你说的黑是什么黑](https://isux.tencent.com/articles/dark-mode.html)

近一年，随着iOS和安卓陆续支持了深色模式，各个团队的一通操作，也的确为用户带来“眼前一黑”的体验。深色模式也成为了前阵子业界最火的话题之一。只是当设计师看了无数的关于深色模式的讨论；当无数产品跟进上线了深色模式；再当无数App的深色模式被骂的改了又改，回头来看看，你说的黑，到底是什么黑。
