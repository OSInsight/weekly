[https://www.robinwieruch.de/web-development-trends/](https://www.robinwieruch.de/web-development-trends/)

Hopefully I was able to provide you with a great overview of the status quo in the web development ecosystem.

[https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/pull/5487#issuecomment-1409720741](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/pull/5487#issuecomment-1409720741)

An extensive write up from Dan Abramov on the state of Create React App, a route to take it forwards, and how he sees React as a library working within an ecosystem of frameworks.

The company behind the Gatsby React-based framework is joining Netlify with many Gatsby Cloud features expected to be integrated into Netlify’s own platform. This places Netlify more directly against Vercel who are behind Next.js (and don't forget Shopify with Remix too).

## 大前端
### JS
Updates from the 94th TC39 meeting
[https://dev.to/hemanth/updates-from-the-94th-tc39-meeting-48mb](https://dev.to/hemanth/updates-from-the-94th-tc39-meeting-48mb)

There were several items on the agenda, this post focuses on feature proposals and their progress from the 94th TC39 meeting. The TC39 committee that works on the ECMAScript standard met last week and progressed a few language proposals with Change Array by Copy, Intl.NumberFormat v3 and Symbols as WeakMap Keys making it to stage 4. There’s also an interesting example of adowngradeto stage 2 for import assertions.

You’ve Got Options for Removing Event Listeners
[https://www.macarthur.me/posts/options-for-removing-event-listeners](https://www.macarthur.me/posts/options-for-removing-event-listeners)

Reviewing some of the most common approaches available to remove event listeners in JavaScript.

- Use .removeEventListener() if the callback function is assigned to a variable and within easy reach of where the listener was added.
- Use the once option in .addEventListener() if you need to fire a callback only once (duh).
- Use the clone & replace approach if you need to indiscriminately nuke multiple listeners in one fell swoop.
- Use AbortController() if you have a series of listeners you’d like to imperatively remove at once, or if you just like the syntax.
### Browser

Again in 2023, all major browser vendors, and other stakeholders, work together to solve the top browsers compatibility issues.

Interop 2022: Outcomes
[https://hacks.mozilla.org/2023/01/interop-2022-outcomes/](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2023/01/interop-2022-outcomes/)

Now that it’s 2023 and we’re deep into preparations for the next iteration of Interop, it’s a good time to reflect on how the first year of Interop has gone. All the signs are that Interop 2022 was helpful in aligning implementations of the web and ensuring that users are able to retain a free choice of browser without running into compatibility problems.
### Node.js
Node + SWC make a lightning fast typescript runtime

If the added compilation time for TypeScript has irritated you so far, Artem has found a way to get things as fast as possible.
### CSS
The Guide To Responsive Design In 2023 and Beyond
[https://ishadeed.com/article/responsive-design/](https://ishadeed.com/article/responsive-design/)

The term “responsive” means a lot of things now. We have media queries that check for user preferences, and modern CSS features that help us make a fluid layout without even using a media query. Responsive is different nowadays. It’s an exciting time, indeed!

Container Queries and Typography
[https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/container-queries-and-typography/](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/container-queries-and-typography/)

2013 vs 2023. Just look how much it’s grown! The infinite cosmic power of CSS in 2023!
### React
Why React isn't dying
[https://tkdodo.eu/blog/why-react-isnt-dying](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/why-react-isnt-dying)

There's a bit of fuzz, mainly on Twitter, about React dying and other libraries being better than React, and that you're doing something wrong or missing out if you're choosing React right now.
### PWA
PWA 技术在游戏落地中的探索
[https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/wyKEBkScfmGkoJlngMC0hA](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/wyKEBkScfmGkoJlngMC0hA)

其实我个人更倾向把各种小程序认为是 PWA 在国内的实践落地，换句话说，各种小程序其实是拿来主义的。
